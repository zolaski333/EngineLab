# Changelog

All notable changes to EngineLab are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: minor versions may break
file formats, always with an in-memory migration).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-10

### Added

- Prebuilt Windows release archive (`EngineLab-<version>-win64.zip`) with the
  Visual C++ runtime included, built and published by GitHub Actions on every
  version tag.
- Physical exhaust afterfire with discrete fuel packets, a thermochemical
  ignition delay (engine schema 8), a > 4 kHz crack layer driven by the reaction,
  a mixer switch and a warning when the retained fuel is below the lean limit.
- Directional X-pipe (`crossover`, engine schema 9), passive side-branch
  resonators, tapered ducts, homogenised catalyst substrates and packed mufflers.
- Cycle-authoritative dyno measurement, dense validated ramps and persistent
  dyno sessions.
- Afterfire harness, geometry sensitivity harness and blind A/B clip renderer
  with per-condition reference windows.

### Changed

- The whole project is now in English: user interface, diagnostics, tool
  output and documentation.
- Idle and starting were reworked: port-injection pulse sized
  once per cycle, fuel pushed back past the throttle kept in the airbox, start
  fuel reserve limited to cranking.
- AFR, dyno metrology, intake continuity and DFCO recovery fixes.
- Turbo shaft energy is conserved; output-chain diagnostics report honestly.
- Repository reorganised around a written [vision](VISION.md); the dated
  measurement history moved out of the tree to the `archive/docs-2026-09` tag.

### Fixed

- Stalls on a standing start caused by flooding.
- Port-injection ratchet at idle.
- Labels with a middle dot (dyno axes, ECU tuner status, gauges) showed `Â·`.
